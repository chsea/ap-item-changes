## Mid-Lane, Best Lane!
Welcome to a new era of AP diversity!
This site is live at http://mid-lane-best-lane.herokuapp.com/.

(Psst, don’t tell anyone I play Hecraim main.)

## Background
This API challenge came at the just the right time in my life. About a month ago, I started attending a Javascript bootcamp to learn web development. A few months before that, I fell in love with League of Legends (in particular watching Esports - I got to watch the NA LCS finals at Madison Square Garden and it was AMAZING, still working on improving my actual playing). This project was the perfect opportunity for me to practice what I’ve learned so far while combining it with a subject I’m passionate about. (Although I’ve now typed ‘item’ so many times, it no longer looks like a real word to me.)

## Comments
This site is particularly focused on bottom-line player statistics like KDA, damage dealt to champions, and win rate as well changes in popularity of champions and items. I choose those areas because I was very curious about the overt effects of the AP item changes, and I was fairly surprised that these stats remained fairly steady.

In hindsight, this makes sense. The patch was designed to diversify player choice, not necessarily improve AP champions’ performance. I think a different route of analysis might be to trace the build path of players and chart shifts in power spikes, power transition curve, and other similarly more subtle statistics that can better speak to players’ gameplay experiences.
